PRACTICAL-CL-CLOJURE
----------------------
A port of selected examples from Practical Common Lisp to Clojure.
The purpose of this port is to explore the intersection between
Lisp and Clojure's signature features: access to the JVM and a 
functional programming style base on immutable collections.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FIRST
------------------------
Read Practical Common Lisp. It's great. Buy a copy.
http://gigamonkeys.com/book/

THEN...
----------------------
Get yourself some Clojure (http://clojure.org) and take 
a look at the code in this project.

BEGGING YOUR PARDON...
----------------------
I wrote this code before I settled on a test framework that I would
use for Clojure code. Such testing as there is is minimal, and has
been added after the fact when dealing with bugs.

For a more representative example of how I think Clojure code should
be tested, check out http://github.com/stuarthalloway/clj-relevance.
