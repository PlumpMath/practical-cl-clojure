PRACTICAL-CL-CLOJURE
----------------------
A port of selected examples from Practical Common Lisp to Clojure.
The purpose of this port is to explore the intersection between
Lisp and Clojure's signature features: access to the JVM and a 
functional programming style base on immutable collections.


WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FIRST
------------------------
Read Practical Common Lisp. It's great. Buy a copy.

THEN...
----------------------
Get yourself some Clojure (http://clojure.org) and take 
a look at the code in this project.


LICENSES

Peter Seibel, the author of Practical Common Lisp, wrote all
the code that inspired this port. The original is available at
